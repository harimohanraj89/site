	    	In my second year at IIT Madras, I met <a href="http://www.thoughtarium.com" target="_blank">Sanjay Guruprasad</a>.
	    	From then on, the two of us spent our time working together on projects of music, theater, and more recently, web development.
	    	We co-founded Nocturne, a web design and development studio, and have a few projects under our name. So far, we have
	    	focused on building websites based on a solid framework, like Wordpress, and completely customizing the user's front-end
	    	experience.

	    	My adventure with Nocturne is quite a nascent one, but is proving to be very exciting. Being able to channelize both my
	    	technical and aesthetic energy through a single medium has been rewarding. You can check us out
