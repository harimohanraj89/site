			<h2>Game Development</h2>

			<p>
				In the Fall of 2012, I attended a course at NYU
				called Advanced Game Audio. The course was taught by
				Jean-Luc Cohen, one of the most interesting people I've ever
				had the pleasure of interacting with. We learned the ins and outs
				of the Unreal Engine. We replaced our character's footsteps with the
				sounds of squeaky toys. We turned our jeep's turbo sound into an 80's
				rock song. In short, this course opened my eyes to an entire
				arena of possibilites, namely game development.
			</p>
			<p>
				One thing led to another, and I found myself at a weekend game jam
				organized by Grasshopper NYC. I found a team of people to work with,
				and we developed a game that went on to be featured in an article by
				Kotaku.
			</p>
			<p>
				That team, along with me, is now Studio Mercato. We're an indie game
				studio based in New York City, that also functions as a label for
				indie game developers.
