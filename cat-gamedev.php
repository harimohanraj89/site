		<h2>Game Development</h2>

		<p>
			In the Fall of 2012, I attended a course at NYU
			called Advanced Game Audio. The course was taught by
			<a href="http://www.jeanlucsinclair.com/" target="_blank">Jean-Luc Cohen</a>, 
			one of the most interesting people I've ever
			had the pleasure of interacting with. We learned the ins and outs
			of the Unreal Engine. We replaced our character's footsteps with the
			sounds of squeaky toys. We turned the noise of our jeep's afterburners into an 80's
			rock song. In short, this course opened my eyes to an entire
			arena of possibilites, namely game development.

			One thing led to another, and I found myself at a weekend game jam
			organized by Grasshopper NYC. I found a team of people to work with,
			and we developed a game that went on to be featured in
			<a href="http://kotaku.com/a-video-game-designed-for-drunk-people-869731464" target="_blank">an article by
			Kotaku</a>.

			That team, along with me, is now Studio Mercato. We're an indie game
			studio based in New York City, that also functions as a label for other
			indie game developers. <a href="http://www.studio-mercato.com" target="_blank">Check us out here</a>.
