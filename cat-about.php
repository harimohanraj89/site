		<h2>About Me</h2>

		<p>
			Hi there. I am a graduate student at New York University, majoring in 
			<a href="http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/music/technology/" target="_blank">Music Technology</a>.
			Our program covers everything from recording and mixing in the studio to
			programming complex audio signal processing systems. As you can probably tell,
			I enjoy the more technical aspects of our program, and work on projects involving
			immersive audio, game audio, and the web. I joined NYU in the Fall of 2011,
			and expect to graduate by the end of Fall 2013.
		</p>

		<p>
			I spent the four years of my undergraduate life at the 
			<a href="http://www.iitm.ac.in" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Technology, Madras</a>.
			IIT Madras is known as one of the best engineering schools in India, if not the world. I graduated
			from IITM in the Summer of 2011, with a bachelors degree in Engineering Physics. This program
			was an even blend of theoretical and applied physics, and electrical engineering. I spent most
			of my time here studying digital signal theory, learning how to live life on my own, and
			organizing (and participating in, of course) music and theater events all year round.
		</p>
		<p>
			Music has been a part of my life since I started piano classes at the age of four.
			Since then, I've shifted my focus to the electric bass, and continue to play with
			as many people as I have time for.
		</p>

			If you like my work, or have any questions or comments, I'd love to hear from you.
